# About tezuka_fw 
**tezuka** (name referenced to [pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto:_Urasawa_x_Tezuka)) aims to be Universal Zynq/AD9363 firmware builder for plutosdr board and other boards: PlutoSDR, Pluto+, AntSDR (e200), LibreSDR.

Target of **tezuka** firmware is to **maximize features** of the board and integrate interesting projects on multi-target boards.

# New features
- Frequencies extension : **47.5Mhz**-6Ghz
- Switch **RX1/RX2 , TX1/TX2** seamlessly
- Complex **8bit mode** to extend streaming bandwidth with host (**14Mhz** stable bandwidth through usb, **45MHz** through GbE network)
- Audio gadget to be recognized as a soundcard (**virtual cable** not needed anymore)
- SD boot support : easy update, no risk of flashing, high amount of memory 
- Include **Maia-sdr** transparently
- Publish basic information about the current state on local mqtt server
- Many other (need to be documented)

# Why not Analog Device or firmware ?
ADI launch PlutoSDR as a learning platform and it is ! But since 2 years, updates are mainly focused on expensive phaser (around 2500 Euros) product https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0566

Thus, official firmware updates are no longer focus on new features for SDR enthusiastic people.

# Installing
- In release section (https://github.com/F5OEO/tezuka_fw/releases)
- Choose your right firmware depending on hardware and software, depending on name.
- Download your selected configuration on https://github.com/F5OEO/tezuka_fw/releases
- Unzip it. If you have a board with SD card, prefere this way for updating your firmware.

Use one the method :
- Flash on memory : paste pluto.frm to pluto drive and eject (detailed update procedure https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto/users/firmware)
- Write SD card : Copy contents of sdimg folder to a fresh FAT32 card formated.

# Configuring
A soon as firmware is updated, you could see a usb drive with parameters in config.txt (orginal parameters are described at (https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto/users/customizing)

# Third party software which could use extra features
- Satdump (https://github.com/F5OEO/SatDump)
- sdr++ (https://github.com/F5OEO/SDRPlusPlus)
- Soapy based software(https://github.com/F5OEO/SoapyPlutoPAPR)

Other great SDR software could use soon new features (SDRConsole, SDRAngel...), stay tuned !

# For developers
## Building from source (linux Debian based)
### Install once
#### Add required packages
Buildroot documentation has the [list of required packages](https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#requirement-mandatory).

The following packages must be installed for building Maia-fw related code:
```bash
sudo apt install pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev
```

Now clone this repo and get buildroot
```bash
git clone https://github.com/F5OEO/tezuka_fw
cd tezuka_fw
./getbuildroot.sh

```
### Build
```bash
source sourceme.first
cd buildroot
# If you want to use the build in a Docker container, then run the following command here:
#  utils/docker-run
make pluto_maiasdr_defconfig && make
```

For a list all supported boards run (this might take a while):
```bash
make list-defconfigs
```
The items at the bottom are the ones supported by Tezuka.

### Building on WSL2 
Buildroot does not allow whitespaces in the PATH environment variable. On WSL several paths with whitespaces are added. The following script can be used to remove any path with whitespaces. It also deletes any leftover ':' at the end:
```bash
export PATH=$(echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | grep -v ' ' | tr '\n' ':' | sed 's/:$//')
```

### Result
All materials are in buildroot/output/images
